# Olympic Medal Prediction using Linear Regression

## 1. Introduction
This project aims to predict Olympic medal counts for countries using machine learning techniques. The objective is to analyze historical Olympic data and develop a predictive model that forecasts the number of medals a country will win based on various factors.

## 2. Dataset Description
The dataset includes information on past Olympic performances, country-specific attributes, and athlete statistics. The key features are:

GDP per Capita: Economic strength of the country

Population: Total population size

Number of Athletes: Participants representing each country

Previous Medal Counts: Performance in past Olympic Games

Hosting Status: Whether the country is hosting the Olympics

Target Variable: Total medal count (Gold, Silver, Bronze)

## 3. Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, normalized numerical features, and encoded categorical data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used visualization tools such as correlation heatmaps and scatter plots to understand trends and relationships between variables.

Feature Engineering: Created new meaningful features such as medals per athlete ratio.

Model Selection: Implemented Linear Regression as the primary model for prediction.

Why Linear Regression?

Interpretability: Linear Regression provides clear insights into how different features (e.g., GDP, number of athletes) affect medal counts.

Baseline Model: It serves as a strong baseline before trying more complex models.

Linearity Assumption: The relationship between independent variables (GDP, athletes, past medals) and the dependent variable (total medals) is approximately linear, making it a suitable choice.

Computational Efficiency: Compared to complex models, Linear Regression is computationally efficient and easy to implement.

Feature Importance: The model helps determine the most influential factors affecting medal count through regression coefficients.

Model Evaluation: Used metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to assess model performance.

## 4. Results and Evaluation
The Linear Regression model provided useful insights with a reasonable R-squared score, indicating a moderate predictive ability. However, its limitations included sensitivity to outliers and the assumption of linearity. The most influential factors were the number of athletes, past medal counts, and GDP per capita.

## 5. Conclusion
The study confirms that economic strength, athletic participation, and historical performance significantly impact a country's Olympic success. While Linear Regression provided a solid baseline model, incorporating more complex models like Ridge Regression or Ensemble Methods could improve accuracy.
